### What I learned

This project turned out to be quite challenging. Unfortunately, limited time made it a lengthy process to complete. Each time I took a break, resuming with a fresh understanding of the code proved difficult. JavaScript presented its own set of hurdles, and the responsive design across different devices was especially complex. I’ve decided that in future projects, I’ll start with a detailed sketch. While I began with mobile and moved up to tablet and desktop, I faced unique challenges at each breakpoint, often requiring code adjustments. I also learned that separating media queries into a dedicated file made reading and updating the code much easier. On multiple occasions, I accidentally altered my original code, causing issues. Overall, it was a long marathon for me, but I’m pleased with the result.
